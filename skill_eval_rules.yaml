engine_notes:
  algorithm:
    - Compute overall as weighted average.
    - Map each domain score to level.
    - Sort domains ascending by score and pick resources per level.
    - Apply signal boosts and distribute by weeks with caps.
    - Inject soft-skill routines when below intermediate.
    - Append course resources for grades below threshold.
    - Append weekly habits.
    - Build advice from recommendation rules.
